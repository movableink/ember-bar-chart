# Advanced Usage

If the short-cut of rendering a `<chart.Bar />` component is not right for you and you need more control over the actual `<rect />` element inserted into the DOM, you can do that too!

<Usage::Rect />

Other use-cases for rendering in this way are altering the shape of the bars or adding in {{docs-link 'text labels' 'docs.cookbook.labels'}}.
